# GifTastic

# My version of the GifTastic project was based around the topic of cars. The page is populated with a list of car companies. When a company is clicked, utilizing the giphy api, related gifs will populate on the page.

# When a gif is clicked, it animate. When it is clicked again, the animation stops.

# There is also a search box that allows you to add to the list of car companies. Once added, it takes on the same functionality as the other buttons
